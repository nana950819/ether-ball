# Etherball ðŸŽŸ
Etherball is a simple lottery system composed of a back-end built with Node.js, Solidity, and Truffle to run on the Ethereum blockchain, and a front-end created using Bootstrap, Web3, and HTML+CSS. I made Etherball to try to get a grasp of the full-stack process behind creating Ethereum DApps.

## Features
Etherball features:  

 â€¢ Integration with all major Ethereum testnets  

 â€¢ Works with the Metamask wallet and Mist browser  

 â€¢ Easy to purchase ticket interface (and prevention of duplicate tickets)  

 â€¢ A simple but functional interface built with Bootstrap  

 â€¢ A blockchain-based nondeterministic randomness generator

## Visit
The current link to use Etherball is https://lottery-ccadyzdork.now.sh, though this link is subject to change.

## Installation
Installing Etherball to use on your machine is simple. First,  

`git clone`  

the repository to get the files onto your system. Next, install the necessary Node.js modules with  

`npm install`  

Create and place your mnemonic private key at the location  

`keystore/eth_keystore.txt`  

If you plan on changing the `Lottery.sol` source code, you'll want to  

`truffle migrate`  

Finally, to initialize and open the Node server,  

`npm run dev`

## Other
 â€¢ The majority of the code powering the app is located in `contracts/Lottery.sol` and `src/js/app.js` - if you'd like to see how I edit it in any way, that's probably the place to go.

 â€¢ The source of randomness for this lottery system comes from a SHA-256 hash taken from the blockchain timestamp and number.

## Technologies Used
 â€¢ Truffle  

 â€¢ Node.js  

 â€¢ HTML/CSS  

 â€¢ TestRPC  

 â€¢ Bootstrap  

 â€¢ Web3
